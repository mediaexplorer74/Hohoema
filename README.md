Hohoema is [tor4kichi](https://twitter.com/tor4kichi) I have a lot of work to do, but I have a lot of work to do.In addition, we have made while getting cooperation in Twitter, Github, FeedbackHub, etc., such as problem report and actual machine confirmation.

For the motivation of the production also [review in the store] ((ms-windows-store://pdp/?ProductID=9nblggh4rxt6)).

In addition, financial support has become possible from "Settings" → "Add-on of Hohoema (bottom of the page)" → "Support Hohoema" in the Hohoema app.(30% of sales in the store will be deducted from Microsoft as a fee.)）

We will continue to Nico move players that can be used, so thank you for your support.
